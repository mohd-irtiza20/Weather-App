# Project Title

The weather app is a web application that utilizes the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide users with real-time weather information. It uses an API to access data from a weather service provider.

The user interface of the app is designed using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and user-friendly layout. Users can enter their location by typing in a city name. Once the location is entered, the app uses JavaScript to make a call to the weather API, which returns the current weather conditions for the specified location.
